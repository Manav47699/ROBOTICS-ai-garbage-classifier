# ROBOTICS-ai-garbage-classifier

# june 28 2025, day 1: Planned my 2nd ROBOTICS project after PID line follower robot.
-> researched about the roadmap on achiving this product and also search for the ways to make it most effective.

# june 29 2025, day 2: Discovered about OpenCV for webcamp acess and mediapipe for Hand gesture tracking
-> downloaded "openCV" and "mediapipe" and got it all working with the help of an AI generated python script.

# june 30 2025, day 3: Build my 1st test coustom model. Needs a lot of work as of now. Will try transfer learning tomorrow
-> build/downloaded pen_paper_classifier with my own dataset

# july 1, day 4:tried building a model with my own data set. If works fine in validation dataaset but flops on random testing data
-> tired a lot to debug this problem but i wasn't succesfulâ˜¹.

# july 2, day 5: researched a bit about YOLO as my custom CNN was acting way too inaccurate
-> Wrote the code for YOLO with AI's help but I took a lot more time to train than I had initally guessed. SO I WILL DO IT TOMMOROW.
