# ROBOTICS-ai-garbage-classifier

-> I will be posting my progress report here :)).

# june 28 2025, day 1: Planned my 2nd ROBOTICS project to be a AI_garbage_classifier_system after PID line follower robot.
-> researched about the roadmap on achiving this product and also search for the ways to make it most effective.

# june 29 2025, day 2: Discovered about OpenCV for webcamp acess and mediapipe for Hand gesture tracking
-> downloaded "openCV" and "mediapipe" and got it all working with the help of an AI generated python script.

# june 30 2025, day 3: Build my 1st test custom CNN model. Needs a lot of work as of now. Will try transfer learning tomorrow
-> build/downloaded pen_paper_classifier with my own dataset

# july 1, day 4:tried building a model with my own data set. If works fine in validation dataaset but flops on random testing data
-> tired a lot to debug this problem but i wasn't succesful☹.

# july 2, day 5: researched a bit about YOLO as my custom CNN was acting way too inaccurate
-> Wrote the code for YOLO with AI's help but I took a lot more time to train than I had initally guessed. SO I WILL DO IT TOMMOROW.

# july 3, day 6: setup yolov5 and got it runing somehow after hours of chatgpting🥱
-> built my first yolo model, downloaded it and set up everything.

# july 4, day 7: learned how to use TinkerCAD for ckt designing and testing.
-> created a account in TinkerCAD and built a few ckts testing different components such as Arduino UNO, leds, IR and ultrasonic sensors and many more !

# july 5, day 8: Design a demo hack-a-thon project's ckt in tinkerCAD and it works 😁.
-> here the link to the ckt --> https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2TMN1thgRsH-techo-morph-project

# july 16, day 9: Connect the python code in VSCODE with the CPP code in Arduino IDE with the help of virtual serial communication. AND IT WORK😎😎😎😎. Man sometimes I feel like a true GENIUS
-> used this -> https://freevirtualserialports.com/ . also fuck gemini. that fool couldn't solve in 3 hrs what chatGPT did in 15 mins.
